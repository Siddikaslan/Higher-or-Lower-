# üìä Follower Comparison Game

A fun and interactive terminal-based game built with Python. Your goal is simple: guess which public figure has more followers and keep your streak alive!

## üéÆ Gameplay

    Two random people are selected from a dataset.

    You‚Äôll see their name, description, and country‚Äîbut not their follower count.

    If you're correct, your score increases and the game continues.

    A wrong guess ends the game and shows your final score.
